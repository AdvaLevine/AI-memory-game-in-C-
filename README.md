Memory game in C# with AI

This project is one of my favourites, it's a memory game like we used to play as kids! how nostalgic!
I had the plesure to code it with a friend of mine from my college during a C# and .NET course
Learned so much about the amazing technologies and abilities of coding and the new framework, experienced first hand and enjoyed every second of it.
After only coding in c and c++ for a year, C# is the first advanced high language i got to use, and i think that a true love is forming on my side.
Such an amazing, logical, simple and yet super complex at the same time, feels like cherries and cream, but we're out of the context!

overall the game is not as complex, logic pretty simple yet its so much fun and satisfying to win!
the game has the menu options to play against computer, which's a little bit better than the normal player, 
but either way, enjoyed creating the game, really fun and educational!
